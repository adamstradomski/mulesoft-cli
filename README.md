# This is a patch for https://www.npmjs.com/package/anypoint-cli

Mulesoft Anypoint CLI is missing  'Revoke a given API contract' that is available in Anypoint Manager API. 

This patch adds the `api-mgr contract revoke <apiInstanceId> <clientId>` command that leverages existing Anypoint Manager API to revoke a contract.
